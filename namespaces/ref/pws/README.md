This is a reference collection of Public Water Systems. These features should be considered community cataloging features and can be referenced as such. 

The current implementation creating these ids and landing-content is in: https://github.com/ksonda/geoconnex_prep and hosted on
https://info.geoconnex.us/collections/pws.

The landing-content is based on Service Area Boundaries where available, which is currently:

 - CA
 - NC
 - NJ
 - PA
 - TX

Landing-content for everywhere else is based on the centroid of the state in which the water sysstem is.

The .gpkg source for the landing content is available [here.](https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/4a22e88e689949afa1cf71ae009eaf1b/data/contents/pws.gpkg)
